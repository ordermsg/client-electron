## Disclosing security vulnerabilities
Please disclose security vulnerabilities responsively. E-Mail me (`portasynthinca3@gmail.com`) about any security vulnerabilities. You should expect a response within 48 hours, though I will try to reply within 12 hours. If I do not reply within a week though, feel free to disclose it publicly.

I will receive your report and do my best to mitigate the vulnerability. Feel free to disclose it two weeks after the patch has been pushed to master if it's client-related, or immediately after me saying it's fixed if it's backend-related. Thank you.
